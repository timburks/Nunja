Nunja is a small portable web server for use with Nu.

It is based on the libevent event notification library
(http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/), and has been tested
on OS X 10.5 and Linux (Ubuntu-7.10) systems. 
	
REQUIREMENTS

Nunja requires Nu and nuke, the Nu build tool. To obtain
Nu, please visit http://programming.nu or get the source
from the Nu git repository on github:
	http://github.com/timburks/nu
	
Nunja requires libevent. Before building Nunja, please 
be sure that libevent is installed on your system. The
default build configuration expects libevent to be installed
in /usr/local.

On Linux systems, Nunja requires an implementation of the
Foundation classes. It has been tested with NuFound, a
modified version of the libFoundation library that has been
updated to work with Nu and which can be built using the
GNU autotools. The primary NuFound repository is on github: 
	http://github.com/timburks/nufound
	
The primary Nunja repository is also on github:
	http://github.com/timburks/nunja
	
INSTALLATION

After installing all prerequisites, build the Nunja framework
by typing "nuke" in the top-level Nunja directory.

AN EXAMPLE

Nunja can be run from the command line using the "nunjad" 
(nunja daemon) script.  nunjad accepts arguments that can
be used to specify a port and a site description. A sample
site description is in the sample directory. To run it in
Nunja, use the following command:
	nunjad --site sample
	
Currently the sample site is very simple, but illustrates
the processing of GET and POST requests and the basics of
response generation, including the use of cookies.

INFLUENCES

Nunja is modeled on Blake Mizerany's Sinatra, 
	http://sinatra.rubyforge.org/
but has the clarity and transparency of implementation
that can only be achieved with Objective-C and Nu.
